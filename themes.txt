Health care:

Health care is an essential service, and our ability to provide quality health care as well as store, share and analyze health information is directly tied to improved technology. Particularly with the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, technology has been used to create solutions to track and minimize the spread of the virus. We look forward to seeing what technological creations you will develop to contribute to this field.


Education:

Education develops effective leaders and innovators of tomorrow. Technology has played a significant role in recent years in allowing education to have a larger reach and allowing the teaching and learning processes to occur more smoothly. Especially during the current pandemic, the internet and video call services have allowed for learning to continue even while we are restricted at home.
